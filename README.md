# iBlog-Platform# iBlog - My Blog Platform

## About
This is a simple blog platform I built while learning web development.  
It’s not perfect yet, but I’m proud that I coded it myself and got it working.  
The idea is to have a place where articles can be shown, filtered by year, and a contact form for users.

## Features
- Navigation bar with search option
- Contact form with background image
- Year filter section (basic version)
- Clean layout with footer

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- (JavaScript planned for future improvements)

## Future Plans
- Make the year filter actually work (show only selected year’s articles)
- Add comments section
- Add dark mode
- Make the site fully responsive for mobile

## How to Run
Just clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iblog-platform.git
